## About

Keyphrases represent the most important information of text as a list of phrases, which often serves as a surrogate for efficiently summarizing text documents.
With the advancement of deep neural networks, recent years have witnessed rapid development in automatic identification of keyphrases.
The performance of keyphrase extraction methods has been greatly improved by the progresses made in natural language understanding, and natural language generation techniques enabling models to predict relevant phrases not mentioned in the text.
We name the task of summarizing texts with phrases **keyphrasification**.

In this half-day tutorial, we provide a comprehensive overview of keyphrasification as well as hands-on practice with popular models and tools.
This tutorial covers important topics ranging from basics of the task to the advanced topics and applications. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have better understanding of 1) classical and state-of-the-art keyphrasification methods, 2) current evaluation practices and their issues, and 3) current trends and future directions in keyphrasification research.
